Why do I get a ``No GreatFET devices found!`` error when my GreatFET is plugged in?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible that your GreatFET has been connected to the USB1 side, which is where your target device should be plugged in. To fix this you will want to connect your GreatFET to your host device (such as your computer) via the USB0 side. There are USB0 and USB1 labels on the board.
